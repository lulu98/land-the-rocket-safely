# Land the rocket safely
Demonstration video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgEoh1r5_4A
## Introduction
You are the pilot of a rocket. You start from a launch pad and you have to steer the rocket safely to a landing pad which is located some distance away from the launch pad.   
On the way to the landing pad you have to maneuver through obstacles and you have an enemy following your every move. Fortunately, you have a boost to escape from the enemy and you can even shoot it. The problem is that it will duplicate as soon as it gets hit by one of your guns. If the enemy hits you or you hit the ground or an obstacle, you are reset to the launch pad. 
Along the way, you can also collect coins. If you collect one, another one is rather randomly generated at a special location a few metres away from your current location.  
I integrated sound for the rocket boosters and sound for the collection of coins.  
The game camera is programmed in such a way that it will follow your moves. 
## Technical aspects
The game is programmed with Unity 5.
