# Land the rocket safely
You are the pilot of a rocket. You start from a launch pad and you have to stir the rocket safely to a landing pad which is placed in some distance from the launch pad.   
On the way to the landing pad you have to maneuver through obstacles and you have an enemy following every move of you. Fortunately, you have a boost to flee from the enemy and you can even shoot it. The problem is that it will duplicate if you hit it. And each duplication will multiply if you hit it. If the enemy hits you or you hit the ground or an obstacle, you are reset to the launch pad. 
On the way you can also collect coins. If you collect one, it is rather randomly generated on a special location a few metres away.  
I integrated sound for the rocket boosters and sound for the collection of coins.  
The game camera is programmed in such a way that it will follow your moves.
